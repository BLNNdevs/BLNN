Description: Software to build and train two layer feed-forward artificial neural networks
    using bayesian methods for weight training. The software impliments the No-U-Turn (NUTS) sampler
    and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with dual averaging. Estimation of hyperparameter values can be done
    through the evidence procedure. This package can be used for multiple statistical models including,
    linear/multiple regression, logistic regression, classification, survival analysis, among others.
