## Getting Started

These instructions will give you some basic instructions on installing the BLNN package and where to look for additional information. 

### Installing

To install the BLNN package from the GitHub repository, run the function 
```R
install_github("BLNNdevs/BLNN")
```
This will pull all the necessary functions for performing your bayesian learning.

### Vignettes

The package repository contains helpful vignette files with full write-ups on example work done using BLNN. If you wish to install these vignettes into R along with the package they will need to be included explicitly durring instalation. To build your version of the package including vignettes be sure to include the build_vignettes argument

```R
